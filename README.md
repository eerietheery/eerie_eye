### Waveform Display

The waveform display is a powerful feature that allows you to visualize and select specific parts of your image for effect application.

#### How to Use the Waveform Display

1. **Viewing the Waveform**
   - The waveform display appears below the main image canvas
   - It shows the intensity distribution of the image across its width
   - Each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) is represented by its respective color

2. **Making Selections**
   - Click and drag on the waveform to make a selection
   - You can make multiple selections on different parts of the waveform
   - Each selection can be on a different color channel

3. **Modifying Selections**
   - Click and drag the edges of a selection to resize it
   - Click in the middle of a selection and drag to move it
   - Right-click on a selection to delete it

4. **Applying Effects to Selections**
   - When you apply an effect, it will only be applied to the areas of the image corresponding to your selections
   - If no selections are made, the effect will be applied to the entire image

5. **Changing Channel Focus**
   - Use the channel selector buttons (R, G, B) above the waveform to focus on a specific color channel
   - This allows for more precise selections on individual channels

6. **Clearing Selections**
   - Use the "Clear Selections" button to remove all current selections

### Applying Effects with Selections

1. Make your desired selections on the waveform display.
2. Choose an effect and adjust its parameters.
3. Click "Apply Glitch" to apply the effect only to the selected areas.
4. The effect will be previewed in real-time as you adjust parameters.

### Troubleshooting

- If an effect isn't visible, ensure that the parameters are set to values that produce noticeable changes.
- If the application becomes unresponsive, try resetting the image and reapplying effects.
- For optimal performance, work with images of reasonable size (e.g., under 4000x4000 pixels).

### Future Developments

The eerieEye team is continuously working on improving the application. Future updates may include:
- Additional glitch effects and filters.
- Batch processing capabilities.
- Custom effect chaining and presets.
- Enhanced undo/redo functionality.
- Performance optimizations for larger images.
